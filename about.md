If in a year's time I have 5 posts in this blog, someone buy me a beer. If I have 10 buy be a nice dinner. If I have more than that, well,  don't know what happen, I've always been unable to maintain a personal website/blog.

##Â Love/Hate

Likes and dislikes are probably the quickest way to tell if you're going to get along for with someone, and some say we are more bound by the things we hate, so... I hate people that won't shut up during tech talks next to me (brand new), I hate the guy on the tube that is trying to have a baby with me (there's no more space). I hate tool boots, since I never understood why they are so expensive and I absolutely hate bullfights, there's no way you can tell me that's culture and/or tradition.

I love food, LeBron James, Porto, my friends, food and also a good scare to remind myself I'm not dead yet.

## What do I do for money?

Depends how much you offer (wink)

Professionally I'm a Tech Lead at UBS Investment Bank in London and before I've worked at Alert Life Sciences Computing back in Portugal. I like software development of all sorts, but I've mainly spend these last years doing web development.

## What else?

I'm an adrenaline junkier and sports fanatic.
